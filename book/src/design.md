# Project description

This is a RPG based on the Pen&Paper Shadowrun, with rogue-like elements : perma-death and procedural generated content.  
The basic loop is to do runs (missions) for various clients, earn money, karma (xp) and glory until you can retire or go in the legend with one last impossible run.  
On a big picture point of view, the player will have to keep their team together, deal with some backfire situations and avoir making too much enemies.  


# Main character

The player controls one character, a ShadowRunner, with the desire to retire with a lot of money or goes into legend with one last big run.  
The character is to be created like any roleplaying character: race, stats, skills and so forth.  
As a Shadowrunner, they will have to recruit a team to cover some missing skills or to reduce the risk of death.  
A stretch goal is to have the player working their relationship with various recruits, mission givers, contacts but also with different factions that can be friends or foes depending of the day.  


# Story
The basic story is that as a ShadowRunner wanabe, the player wants to make a place in the shadow world.  
Procedural generated missions will make the story by pitching them against various factions, but they should be able to make sense of their clients objectives and maybe take advantage of this knownledge. Legwork and mission planification are all about that.    
Story elements could also come from having to watch their back as any run going awry could lead to consequences during between-jobs periods but also during other runs.  
There should be a life outside of runs.  


# Theme
The world is in late stage capitalism and the player will go against various gangs, criminals, corporations on behalf of other scums most of the time.  
Life doesn't worth much, but the player is motivated to keep theirs and maybe, maybe, do some good on the way.  


# Story progression
The player start in some place where they can found a run or two, working their way to earn confidence and get more payed jobs.  
Each run give them access to new places, where they can do some detective work before the actual run, gaining insights about what's going on and more places to visit.  
In the most humble version most of the story is about getting newly and more payed jobs but as the game gains more content the player should be able to develop their own goals like the fall of some Corporation CEO or banning some evil spirit threatening the city.  
Death puts an end to the character story but the world story can go on and the player comes back with a new character.  


# Gameplay
Combat will be mostly turn and action points based, with one to four characters to play in your team.  
Character progression is made by doing runs or dealing with various events, not killing everything. In fact, the pacific or stealth way should also provide progression.  
Each run should offer a bit of detective work, where the player looks for safe ways to accomplish their mission or understand it and take advantage of the knowledge.  


# Goals
overall: To earn a lot of money or reputation.  
shortterm: Accomplish various runs with success.  
longterm: Staying alive through all factions schemes and conspiracies while being a pawn and watchout for any opportunity to become a queen in the chestgame that is the world of Shadowrun.  


# User skills
Tactical combats,  
detective work,  
resource management,  
relationship with the different game actors.  


# Game mecanics
Skills and stats are improved by karma (xp).   
Weapons, armors and spells and cyberware are bought, as making money is a major motivation for the character, but contacts and friends maybe needed to access to the more powerfull and out of market ones.  
The player will be of need of some kind of device to keep track of their contacts, friends, foes and clients.  
Traveling through the city could require some access papers, official or forged.  
Stealth and infiltration technics should be available for a low profile kind of game.  
Maybe some place to rent where they could statch their stuff, with hidden places through the city in case their main hideout is blown.  


# Challenge
Missions will be harder and harder if the player is looking for Reputation or money, and require more preparation and exit plans.  
As the player does missions, a lot of heat will come on them since any target may want to exact vengeance or show the world that you can't take on them.  
Betrayal may happens if relationships are not taken care of.
